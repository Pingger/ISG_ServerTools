# ISG_ServerTools

*Please read and respect the License.*  
This Project is intended for my own needs of functions on spigot servers. There is quite a bit **explorative Programming** involved, but I try to keep an eye on Security.

At the moment this Plugin is entirely controlled by the configuration File.

### General-Aim
 - Configuration changes are detected and automatically applied, without the requirement to reload the plugin or server (at the moment this is only partially the case)
 - Good configurability
 - Good Performance
 - A good command interface with Tab-Completion and Help-Pages
 - A general Purpose Plugin
